      <dt>Frontend Frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular)</dt>
      <dd>
        These frameworks are used for building the user interface (UI) of web
        applications. They provide tools and components for creating interactive
        and dynamic user experiences.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        Backend Frameworks (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Ruby on Rails)
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Backend frameworks handle server-side logic and database interactions.
        They help in building the server-side components of web applications,
        including routing, handling requests, and interacting with databases.
      </dd>

      <dt>Database Management Systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)</dt>
      <dd>
        These systems are used to store and manage data for web applications.
        They provide mechanisms for storing, querying, and manipulating
        structured data, ensuring efficient data management.
      </dd>

      <dt>Version Control Systems (e.g., Git)</dt>
      <dd>
        Version control systems are used to track changes to code, collaborate
        with team members, and manage project versions. Git, in particular, is
        widely used for its distributed version control capabilities.
      </dd>

      <dt>Frontend Build Tools (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, Gulp)</dt>
      <dd>
        Build tools are used to automate tasks such as compiling, bundling, and
        optimizing frontend assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They
        streamline the development process and improve performance.
      </dd>

      <dt>Backend Deployment Platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)</dt>
      <dd>
        These platforms provide infrastructure and services for deploying and
        hosting backend applications. They offer scalable and reliable solutions
        for deploying web applications to production environments.
      </dd>

      <dt>Containerization and Orchestration (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)</dt>
      <dd>
        Containerization tools like Docker enable packaging applications and
        their dependencies into lightweight containers, ensuring consistency
        across different environments. Kubernetes helps in automating
        deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
